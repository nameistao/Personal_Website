## Project Name & Pitch

Personal Website

My personal website build using React and Next.js

## Project Context

This project was for converting my old personal website, which used bootstrap, to this one, which uses react and next. I wanted the tools
used to build my latest personal website to reflect the technologies that I am currently using. 

The website displays my employment history, skills, and projects.
